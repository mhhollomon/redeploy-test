I thought I would take a moment and document my current development environment.

The main computer runs windows 10. However, the development computer is actually a VirtualBox ArchLinux client running on that Win 10 box. I use X11 Forwarding to display back to an cygwin/X server running on the host.

I am currently using Codelite as my IDE, though it has some rough edges. GNU compiler suite rounds things out.
