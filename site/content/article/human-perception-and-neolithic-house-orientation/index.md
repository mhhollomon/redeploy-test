## Lifestyles of the Neolithic

It is  bout 8,000 years ago in Central Europe. You and your clan are trying
out the latest lifestyle craze "farming". You live in what modern scholars call
"longhouses" - 15-20 feet wide and around 100 feet long, short walls with an
extreme pitched roof.

You were born in this house; your children were born in this house. But now it
is time to build a new one[^1].

[^1]: Archeologist don't have many clues on why a house was abandoned.

The clan picks a spot about 100 yards away from the old house and rebuilds. For
reasons only know to you, you go to particular pains to make the new house have
the same orientation as the old - the new house will be parallel to the old
one[^2].

[^2]: Not "lined up with" the old one, but with the same alignment.

Except that it isn't. The new house is mis-aligned by 3-5 degrees. This could
be because of random error, *except* the error is always *in the same
direction* - counter-clockwise.

## To the left[^3]

[^3]: Yes, I stole the header (see resources). Its a great one.

Humans (and other animals) have a slight flaw in their perception systems.
Healthy, neurotypical humans have a slight bias in visual perception to the
left side. This is true for both left and right handers. As a result, for
instance, when asked to bisect a horizontal line, they will place the divider
slightly to the left side. When they are asked to imagine themselves in a
well-known location and describe what they see, more information will be given
about what is on the left side of the imagined visual field. This bias is
called *pseudoneglect*.

So when you and your clan set about the task of creating a parallel structure,
the left side will be slightly closer, rotating the structure counter-clockwise
from the intended orientation.

And of course, in 30-50 years when your grand-children build a new longhouse,
it will *also* be rotated counter-clockwise - 3-5 degrees from this new house
and 6-10 degrees from the "original".

## How this can be used

When archeologist are examing a village, the only way to truly figure out the
order in which houses were built is through the expensive process of sampling
organic material (e.g. from poles that held up the building) and then doing
[Carbon-14](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/carbon-14.htm)
dating. This has to be done for each building in order to place them
in the timeline. This is expensive, both in time and in money.

Using the fact that orientation will drift over time, the scientist can at
least establish a likely *relative* order to the houses. Then prudent sampling
can firm up the time range.

And it get better. Since all we need to know is where the houses were and how
they were oriented, we don't even need to do a full-scale excavation. Using a
[geophyiscal
survey](https://study.com/academy/lesson/geophysical-surveys-definition-methods.html)
of magnetic anomalies, longhouses can be found based on the disturbed soil in
trenches associated with the buildings. A large number of buildings over a wide
area can be found. The above insight can be used to place them in relative
time. A select few can be excavated to yield an absolute date for the
sequence.

In a world where science frequently gets short time and short money, anything
that allows to extract more information with less is a useful tool.
