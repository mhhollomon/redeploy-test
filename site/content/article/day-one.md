So, I decide to join the blogging crowd. It remains to be seen if it sticks.

#### Why?

I've been doing some home-brew software development lately and found that there were some things I wanted to say and no place to say them. So here is that place.

This won't be all about software development. There will undoubtedly be some music-ish things thrown in. And things about music software and probably software music too.

#### What does the name mean?

Not much. Vamping is used in music to mean an small mostly improvised section of music over a very small chord set used to either kill time or to support a soloist.

Apparently it also means to put a new upper on a shoe.

The main reason I picked the name is that it didn't appear to be used by anybody.

To quote Vonnegut - "And so it goes"
