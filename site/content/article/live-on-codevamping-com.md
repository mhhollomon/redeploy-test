Now officially live on the new blog at [codevamping.com](https://codevamping.com)!

The new site uses:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - site building
- [Jeffprod](https://github.com/Tazeg/hugo-blog-jeffprod) - theme
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - hosting
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) - automated build for scheduled posts
- [Google](https://domains.google.com/) - as domain registrar.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - for repostory hosting.

I still have posts to migrate from the old site. That is a bit of pain, since it wasn't originally written in Markdown. One tool that has been indispensible is [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io). Among other things, it can read html and spit out a pretty good guess at equivalent markdown.
